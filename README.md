# CinemaScore Predictor: An AI Model for IMDb Rating Prediction

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model that can predict the IMDb score of a movie based on key attributes such as the director, budget, lead actor, and genre. This tool aims to assist film studios, investors, and enthusiasts in predicting the potential reception of a movie before its release, thereby aiding in strategic decision-making for production, marketing, and investment.

## Dataset
### Source:
We will compile data from the IMDb movie database. This dataset will include:
- **Director:** Names of directors.
- **Budget:** The total budget in USD.
- **Actor:** Names of lead actors.
- **Genre:** Categorized genres of the movie.
- **IMDb Score:** The actual IMDb score of the movie.

### Size:
- **5,000 movies** to ensure the model has enough data to learn from, considering the variety in directors, actors, and genres.

### Cleaning:
- Handle missing values.
- Normalize budget figures.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., director, actor, genre).

---

## Initial Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualize the distribution of IMDb scores.
- Analyze the correlation between budget and IMDb scores.
- Explore how different genres affect scores.

### Feature Engineering:
- Create interaction features between director-genre, actor-genre, etc., to capture combined effects.
- Use techniques like one-hot encoding or embedding for categorical variables.

### Data Insights:
- Identify patterns or anomalies, such as whether certain directors consistently perform better in specific genres or if high-budget films correlate with higher or lower scores.

## Goals
### Model Development:
- **Regression Models:** Develop and evaluate regression models for training.
- **Classification Models:** Develop and evaluate classification models for training.

### Performance Metrics:
- Use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R-squared** to evaluate model performance.
- Implement **cross-validation** to ensure model robustness.

## Deployment
- Develop a simple **web interface** or an **API** where users can input movie details and receive a predicted IMDb score.
- Ensure the model can be updated periodically with new movie data to keep predictions relevant.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more variables like **release date**, **production company**, or sentiment analysis from movie trailers or reviews to improve prediction accuracy.
- Consider **real-time updates** or predictions based on initial audience reactions or festival screenings.
- Integrate other databases, including **Box Office Mojo** and **The Numbers**, for better predictive analysis.
